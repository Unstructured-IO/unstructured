## :eight_pointed_black_star: The Data Connector Blitz  -- Now through midnight March 10, 2023 PST

Let's cut to the chase, we're offering **Cash Prizes**!

-   💸💸💸 1st Place: $5,000 (cold hard  cash!)
-   💰💰 2nd Place: $1,500 (cold hard  cash!)
-   💵 3rd Place: $500 (cold hard  cash!)
-   🎁4th and 5th place: Box of dope Unstructured swag    


###  Goals
 
* To date, we've been focused on making it easy to transform your data. Now we want to improve Unstructured's ability to seamlessly process data from many sources through the `unstructured-ingest` client (see [Ingest.md](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/blob/main/Ingest.md#the-unstructured-ingest-cli))
* Squash bugs!

### Getting Started

* See [Installation Instructions for Local Development](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured#coffee-installation-instructions-for-local-development), and also make sure to follow the "Optional" steps.
* Looking for ideas? We've created a bunch of issues scoped so you can start writing code immediately. See the [issues tagged with enhancement](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement).

### Criteria 

We'll be measuring contributions for both quality and quantity, not the total number of PRs merged into the main branch. New data connectors are important, but so are bug fixes and other usability enhancements. All contributions are encouraged and will be considered in deciding winners. Contributions to dependent libraries such as [unstructured-inference](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-inference) are also welcome.

**Winners will be announced on March 15, 2023!**
