   INTRODUCTION
  </h1>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="647a62884e70fb48d66814696b0ab897">
   The purpose of the TELNET Protocol is to provide a fairly general, bi-directional, eight-bit byte oriented communications facility.  Its primary goal is to allow a standard method of interfacing terminal devices and terminal-oriented processes to each other.  It is envisioned that the protocol may also be used for terminal-terminal communication ("linking") and process-process communication (distributed computation).

   GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
  </h1>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="4d428190fc7fca97cb7467c4b0e45e83">
   A TELNET connection is a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection used to transmit data with interspersed TELNET control information.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="cf93a26711c927e9698cc536bcb1820b">
   The TELNET Protocol is built upon three main ideas:  first, the concept of a "Network Virtual Terminal"; second, the principle of negotiated options; and third, a symmetric view of terminals and processes.
  </p>
  <li class="ListItem" id="717404910d490d67e42cc895767fedb2">
   1.  When a TELNET connection is first established, each end is assumed to originate and terminate at a "Network Virtual Terminal", or NVT.  An NVT is an imaginary device which provides a standard, network-wide, intermediate representation of a canonical terminal. This eliminates the need for "server" and "user" hosts to keep information about the characteristics of each other's terminals and terminal handling conventions.  All hosts, both user and server, map their local device characteristics and conventions so as to appear to be dealing with an NVT over the network, and each can assume a similar mapping by the other party.  The NVT is intended to strike a balance between being overly restricted (not providing hosts a rich enough vocabulary for mapping into their local character sets), and being overly inclusive (penalizing users with modest terminals).
  </li>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="84729a689a78d3b376e01afef5eb499b">
   NOTE:  The "user" host is the host to which the physical terminal is normally attached, and the "server" host is the host which is normally providing some service.  As an alternate point of view,

   RFC 854                                                         May 1983

  </p>
  <li class="ListItem" id="4b094a0eff777fce3c819a7f240760ca">
   2.  The principle of negotiated options takes cognizance of the fact that many hosts will wish to provide additional services over and above those available within an NVT, and many users will have sophisticated terminals and would like to have elegant, rather than minimal, services.  Independent of, but structured within the TELNET Protocol are various "options" that will be sanctioned and may be used with the "DO, DON'T, WILL, WON'T" structure (discussed below) to allow a user and server to agree to use a more elaborate (or perhaps just different) set of conventions for their TELNET connection.  Such options could include changing the character set, the echo mode, etc.
  </li>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="884ec5e72af70723eb2efc80f42508ff">
   The basic strategy for setting up the use of options is to have either party (or both) initiate a request that some option take effect.  The other party may then either accept or reject the request.  If the request is accepted the option immediately takes effect; if it is rejected the associated aspect of the connection remains as specified for an NVT.  Clearly, a party may always refuse a request to enable, and must never refuse a request to disable some option since all parties must be prepared to support the NVT.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="48126945ebf491304faf9cc60d5bc4e4">
   The syntax of option negotiation has been set up so that if both parties request an option simultaneously, each will see the other's request as the positive acknowledgment of its own.
  </p>
  <li class="ListItem" id="0181c0b05baca35b14c1eef5c5d8dd86">
   3.  The symmetry of the negotiation syntax can potentially lead to nonterminating acknowledgment loops -- each party seeing the incoming commands not as acknowledgments but as new requests which must be acknowledged.  To prevent such loops, the following rules prevail:
  </li>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="1cea7b129d4039aa1ab6a6bb6f55d35f">
   a. Parties may only request a change in option status; i.e., a party may not send out a "request" merely to announce what mode it is in.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="322ecfd0741e4e42446517325414e5b6">
   b. If a party receives what appears to be a request to enter some mode it is already in, the request should not be acknowledged. This non-response is essential to prevent endless loops in the negotiation.  It is required that a response be sent to requests for a change of mode -- even if the mode is not changed.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="35478d889f81c38e6a8bc021c85de82f">
   c. Whenever one party sends an option command to a second party, whether as a request or an acknowledgment, and use of the option will have any effect on the processing of the data being sent from the first party to the second, then the command must be inserted in the data stream at the point where it is desired that it take

   effect.  (It should be noted that some time will elapse between the transmission of a request and the receipt of an acknowledgment, which may be negative.  Thus, a host may wish to buffer data, after requesting an option, until it learns whether the request is accepted or rejected, in order to hide the "uncertainty period" from the user.)
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="c686d55ac5718ed9066f7e5ec6f89f08">
   Option requests are likely to flurry back and forth when a TELNET connection is first established, as each party attempts to get the best possible service from the other party.  Beyond that, however, options can be used to dynamically modify the characteristics of the connection to suit changing local conditions.  For example, the NVT, as will be explained later, uses a transmission discipline well suited to the many "line at a time" applications such as BASIC, but poorly suited to the many "character at a time" applications such as NLS.  A server might elect to devote the extra processor overhead required for a "character at a time" discipline when it was suitable for the local process and would negotiate an appropriate option. However, rather than then being permanently burdened with the extra processing overhead, it could switch (i.e., negotiate) back to NVT when the detailed control was no longer necessary.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="63af424472a0a15b145b4530f1dbbf5c">
   It is possible for requests initiated by processes to stimulate a nonterminating request loop if the process responds to a rejection by merely re-requesting the option.  To prevent such loops from occurring, rejected requests should not be repeated until something changes.  Operationally, this can mean the process is running a different program, or the user has given another command, or whatever makes sense in the context of the given process and the given option. A good rule of thumb is that a re-request should only occur as a result of subsequent information from the other end of the connection or when demanded by local human intervention.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="57cce01afb5218dd609ce3eeab822f3e">
   Option designers should not feel constrained by the somewhat limited syntax available for option negotiation.  The intent of the simple syntax is to make it easy to have options -- since it is correspondingly easy to profess ignorance about them.  If some particular option requires a richer negotiation structure than possible within "DO, DON'T, WILL, WON'T", the proper tack is to use "DO, DON'T, WILL, WON'T" to establish that both parties understand the option, and once this is accomplished a more exotic syntax can be used freely.  For example, a party might send a request to alter (establish) line length.  If it is accepted, then a different syntax can be used for actually negotiating the line length -- such a "sub-negotiation" might include fields for minimum allowable, maximum allowable and desired line lengths.  The important concept is that

   In summary, WILL XXX is sent, by either party, to indicate that party's desire (offer) to begin performing option XXX, DO XXX and DON'T XXX being its positive and negative acknowledgments; similarly, DO XXX is sent to indicate a desire (request) that the other party (i.e., the recipient of the DO) begin performing option XXX, WILL XXX and WON'T XXX being the positive and negative acknowledgments.  Since the NVT is what is left when no options are enabled, the DON'T and WON'T responses are guaranteed to leave the connection in a state which both ends can handle.  Thus, all hosts may implement their TELNET processes to be totally unaware of options that are not supported, simply returning a rejection to (i.e., refusing) any option request that cannot be understood.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="477da82b29de29c233ff71d9ef190812">
   As much as possible, the TELNET protocol has been made server-user symmetrical so that it easily and naturally covers the user-user (linking) and server-server (cooperating processes) cases.  It is hoped, but not absolutely required, that options will further this intent.  In any case, it is explicitly acknowledged that symmetry is an operating principle rather than an ironclad rule.

   THE NETWORK VIRTUAL TERMINAL

  <p class="NarrativeText" id="64f30d40e6892c7999c5cdfcfb5e487b">
   The Network Virtual Terminal (NVT) is a bi-directional character device.  The NVT has a printer and a keyboard.  The printer responds to incoming data and the keyboard produces outgoing data which is sent over the TELNET connection and, if "echoes" are desired, to the NVT's printer as well.  "Echoes" will not be expected to traverse the network (although options exist to enable a "remote" echoing mode of operation, no host is required to implement this option).  The code set is seven-bit USASCII in an eight-bit field, except as modified herein.  Any code conversion and timing considerations are local problems and do not affect the NVT.

  </p>
  <li class="ListItem" id="e7ddc718279e45fdb301585e3e2740ee">
   1)  Insofar as the availability of local buffer space permits, data should be accumulated in the host where it is generated until a complete line of data is ready for transmission, or until some locally-defined explicit signal to transmit occurs. This signal could be generated either by a process or by a human user.
  </li>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="fa1690a85361eab491bafb085f1fb45d">
   The motivation for this rule is the high cost, to some hosts, of processing network input interrupts, coupled with the default NVT specification that "echoes" do not traverse the network.  Thus, it is reasonable to buffer some amount of data at its source.  Many systems take some processing action at the end of each input line (even line printers or card punches frequently tend to work this way), so the transmission should be triggered at the end of a line.  On the other hand, a user or process may sometimes find it necessary or desirable to provide data which does not terminate at the end of a line; therefore implementers are cautioned to provide methods of locally signaling that all buffered data should be transmitted immediately.
  </p>
  <li class="ListItem" id="e55b99b7b8020a53a25204ee268cac06">
   2)  When a process has completed sending data to an NVT printer and has no queued input from the NVT keyboard for further processing (i.e., when a process at one end of a TELNET connection cannot proceed without input from the other end), the process must transmit the TELNET Go Ahead (GA) command.
  </li>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="c3a0ec4a25961e41bc7e4b49e3e08bcf">
   This rule is not intended to require that the TELNET GA command be sent from a terminal at the end of each line, since server hosts do not normally require a special signal (in addition to end-of-line or other locally-defined characters) in order to commence processing.  Rather, the TELNET GA is designed to help a user's local host operate a physically half duplex terminal which has a "lockable" keyboard such as the IBM 2741.  A description of this type of terminal may help to explain the proper use of the GA command.

   The terminal-computer connection is always under control of either the user or the computer.  Neither can unilaterally seize control from the other; rather the controlling end must relinguish its control explicitly.

  <p class="NarrativeText" id="3cb6c0dd58c764953c36757e231dfe28">
   The difficulties of using this type of terminal through the network should be obvious.  The "local" computer is no longer able to decide whether to retain control after seeing an end-of-line signal or not; this decision can only be made by the "remote" computer which is processing the data.  Therefore, the TELNET GA command provides a mechanism whereby the "remote" (server) computer can signal the "local" (user) computer that it is time to pass control to the user of the terminal.  It should be transmitted at those times, and only at those times, when the user should be given control of the terminal.  Note that premature transmission of the GA command may result in the blocking of output, since the user is likely to assume that the transmitting system has paused, and therefore he will fail to turn the line around manually.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="e72bb98b45fcd1f2a7eb9af4df4634ba">
   The foregoing, of course, does not apply to the user-to-server direction of communication.  In this direction, GAs may be sent at any time, but need not ever be sent.  Also, if the TELNET connection is being used for process-to-process communication, GAs need not be sent in either direction.  Finally, for terminal-to-terminal communication, GAs may be required in neither, one, or both directions.  If a host plans to support terminal-to-terminal communication it is suggested that the host provide the user with a means of manually signaling that it is time for a GA to be sent over the TELNET connection; this, however, is not a requirement on the implementer of a TELNET process.

   STANDARD REPRESENTATION OF CONTROL FUNCTIONS

   As stated in the Introduction to this document, the primary goal of the TELNET protocol is the provision of a standard interfacing of terminal devices and terminal-oriented processes through the network.  Early experiences with this type of interconnection have shown that certain functions are implemented by most servers, but that the methods of invoking these functions differ widely.  For a human user who interacts with several server systems, these differences are highly frustrating.  TELNET, therefore, defines a standard representation for five of these functions, as described

These standard representations have standard, but not required, meanings (with the exception that the Interrupt Process (IP) function may be required by other protocols which use TELNET); that is, a system which does not provide the function to local users need not provide it to network users and may treat the standard representation for the function as a No-operation.  On the other hand, a system which does provide the function to a local user is obliged to provide the same function to a network user who transmits the standard representation for the function.

This function is frequently used when a user believes his process is in an unending loop, or when an unwanted process has been inadvertently activated.  IP is the standard representation for invoking this function.

   Many systems provide a function which allows a process, which is generating output, to run to completion (or to reach the same stopping point it would reach if running to completion) but without sending the output to the user's terminal. Further, this function typically clears any output already produced but not yet actually printed (or displayed) on the user's terminal.  AO is the standard representation for invoking this function.  For example, some subsystem might normally accept a user's command, send a long text string to the user's terminal in response, and finally signal readiness to accept the next command by sending a "prompt" character (preceded by &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;) to the user's terminal.  If the AO were received during the transmission of the text string, a reasonable implementation would be to suppress the remainder of the text string, but transmit the prompt character and the preceding &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.  (This is possibly in distinction to the action which might be taken if an IP were received; the IP might cause suppression of the text string and an exit from the subsystem.)

   THE TELNET "SYNCH" SIGNAL
  </h1>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="0e2510601de541d3350290ad08cfdd96">
   Most time-sharing systems provide mechanisms which allow a terminal user to regain control of a "runaway" process; the IP and AO functions described above are examples of these mechanisms. Such systems, when used locally, have access to all of the signals supplied by the user, whether these are normal characters or special "out of band" signals such as those supplied by the teletype "BREAK" key or the IBM 2741 "ATTN" key.  This is not necessarily true when terminals are connected to the system through the network; the network's flow control mechanisms may cause such a signal to be buffered elsewhere, for example in the user's host.

   RFC 854                                                         May 1983
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="55141a20286b1e1c70417513e09ea05c">
   To counter this problem, the TELNET "Synch" mechanism is introduced.  A Synch signal consists of a TCP Urgent notification, coupled with the TELNET command DATA MARK.  The Urgent notification, which is not subject to the flow control pertaining to the TELNET connection, is used to invoke special handling of the data stream by the process which receives it.  In this mode, the data stream is immediately scanned for "interesting" signals as defined below, discarding intervening data.  The TELNET command DATA MARK (DM) is the synchronizing mark in the data stream which indicates that any special signal has already occurred and the recipient can return to normal processing of the data stream.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="2ae0117d8852c34228c2067896a1959f">
   The Synch is sent via the TCP send operation with the Urgent flag set and the DM as the last (or only) data octet.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="811e593063f922ec23ca4086bf721756">
   When several Synchs are sent in rapid succession, the Urgent notifications may be merged.  It is not possible to count Urgents since the number received will be less than or equal the number sent.  When in normal mode, a DM is a no operation; when in urgent mode, it signals the end of the urgent processing.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="d6a66cbe761bcff61954c70df02559c6">
   If TCP indicates the end of Urgent data before the DM is found, TELNET should continue the special handling of the data stream until the DM is found.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="89e04790172238dd134938e4e3636e29">
   If TCP indicates more Urgent data after the DM is found, it can only be because of a subsequent Synch.  TELNET should continue the special handling of the data stream until another DM is found.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="957e4cbd3cf03c9c2b704514dceccd8e">
   "Interesting" signals are defined to be:  the TELNET standard representations of IP, AO, and AYT (but not EC or EL); the local analogs of these standard representations (if any); all other TELNET commands; other site-defined signals which can be acted on without delaying the scan of the data stream.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="b26203ad2a3a766e28a2c570a2ec730f">
   Since one effect of the SYNCH mechanism is the discarding of essentially all characters (except TELNET commands) between the sender of the Synch and its recipient, this mechanism is specified as the standard way to clear the data path when that is desired. For example, if a user at a terminal causes an AO to be transmitted, the server which receives the AO (if it provides that function at all) should return a Synch to the user.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="d92ec560295df1cd2860c29e93954e3b">
   Finally, just as the TCP Urgent notification is needed at the TELNET level as an out-of-band signal, so other protocols which make use of TELNET may require a TELNET command which can be viewed as an out-of-band signal at a different level.

   The sequence "CR LF", as defined, will cause the NVT to be positioned at the left margin of the next print line (as would, for example, the sequence "LF CR").  However, many systems and terminals do not treat CR and LF independently, and will have to go to some effort to simulate their effect.  (For example, some terminals do not have a CR independent of the LF, but on such terminals it may be possible to simulate a CR by backspacing.) Therefore, the sequence "CR LF" must be treated as a single "new line" character and used whenever their combined action is intended; the sequence "CR NUL" must be used where a carriage return alone is actually desired; and the CR character must be avoided in other contexts.  This rule gives assurance to systems which must decide whether to perform a "new line" function or a multiple-backspace that the TELNET stream contains a character following a CR that will allow a rational decision.

Even though it may be known in some situations (e.g., with remote echo and suppress go ahead options in effect) that characters are not being sent to an actual printer, nonetheless, for the sake of consistency, the protocol requires that a NUL be inserted following a CR not followed by a LF in the data stream.  The converse of this is that a NUL received in the data stream after a CR (in the absence of options negotiations which explicitly specify otherwise) should be stripped out prior to applying the NVT to local character set mapping.

   The spirit of these "extra" keys, and also the printer format effectors, is that they should represent a natural extension of the mapping that already must be done from "NVT" into "local". Just as the NVT data byte 68 (104 octal) should be mapped into whatever the local code for "uppercase D" is, so the EC character should be mapped into whatever the local "Erase Character" function is.  Further, just as the mapping for 124 (174 octal) is somewhat arbitrary in an environment that has no "vertical bar" character, the EL character may have a somewhat arbitrary mapping (or none at all) if there is no local "Erase Line" facility. Similarly for format effectors:  if the terminal actually does have a "Vertical Tab", then the mapping for VT is obvious, and only when the terminal does not have a vertical tab should the effect of VT be unpredictable.
