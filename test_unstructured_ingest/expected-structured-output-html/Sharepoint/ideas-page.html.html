     January 2023 ( Someone fed my essays into GPT to make something that could answer
     <br/>
     questions based on them, then asked it where good ideas come from.  The
     <br/>
     answer was ok, but not what I would have said. This is what I would have said.) The way to get new ideas is to notice anomalies: what seems strange,
     <br/>
     or missing, or broken? You can see anomalies in everyday life (much
     <br/>
     of standup comedy is based on this), but the best place to look for
     <br/>
     them is at the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge grows fractally.
     <br/>
     From a distance its edges look smooth, but when you learn enough
     <br/>
     to get close to one, you'll notice it's full of gaps. These gaps
     <br/>
     will seem obvious; it will seem inexplicable that no one has tried
     <br/>
     x or wondered about y. In the best case, exploring such gaps yields
     <br/>
     whole new fractal buds.
