   Create a stellar overview
  </h1>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="d36113941235a14bdacafa399698ee71">
   The overview is the first page visitors will see when they visit your space, so it helps to include some information on what the space is about and what your team is working on.
  </p>

  <p class="NarrativeText" id="156af6589ee1a114454df9aa55b88d85">
   Add a header image. This gives your overview visual appeal and makes it welcoming for visitors.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="618dd7e3cee45b5b0f04847b33879336">
   Explain what the space is for. Start by summarizing the purpose of the space. This could be your team's mission statement or a brief description of the kind of work you do.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="ca6d9e5f81ae268b7bbf6b62dad3357b">
   Share team goals. Add links to your team's OKRs, project plans, and product roadmaps so visitors can quickly get a sense of your team's goals.

   Use shortcuts for easy access
  </h1>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="b2d427efb6bb6f37c4afd368cefab926">
   Shortcuts are helpful for important pages that members of a space might need to get to often. These shortcuts are added and organized by the space administrator. Space admins can link to pages in the space, other related spaces, or relevant external web content as well as reorder the shortcuts as needed.

   üí≠Start discussions with inline comments
  </h1>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="bcb788a54a545e7f1448f6e4dacb91eb">
   Thoughtful responses can get lost and lose context as email replies pile up. And if you neglect to copy someone or want to add them later on, it's difficult for them to get up to speed. Inline comments allow anyone (or everyone) to huddle around an idea while referencing key information on the project page.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="c9dd716e43dfb450e3ff4cf59a3b5c63">
   To leave an inline comment, highlight text on the page and the comment icon will appear.
  </p>

  <p class="NarrativeText" id="3452f07fead697f48e719306657044a6">
   Team members with permission to access the page can respond to any comment. Plus, when a comment thread comes to its natural conclusion, comments can be resolved and cleared away.

  <p class="NarrativeText" id="d336ac79f4cbd3245fad05bfbc4c8f2b">
   You can also use reactions on a page or blog post. The author of the content will be notified, and if enough team members react or add comments to the content, it'll be surfaced on Confluence home feed
