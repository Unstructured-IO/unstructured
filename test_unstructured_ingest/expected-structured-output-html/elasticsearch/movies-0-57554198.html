After a while, she leaves.

   The Queen invites Alice to join the "ROYAL PROCESSION": a parade of marching playing cards and others headed by the White Rabbit. When Alice "unintentionally offends the Queen", the latter summons the "Executioner". Alice "boxes the ears", then flees when all the playing cards come for her. Then she wakes up and realizes it was all a dream.
