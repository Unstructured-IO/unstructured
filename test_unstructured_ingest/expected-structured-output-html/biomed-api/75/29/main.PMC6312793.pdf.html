   This data article presents a description of a benchmark dataset for the multiple depot vehicle scheduling problem (MDVSP). The MDVSP is to assign vehicles from different depots to timetabled trips to minimize the total cost of empty travel and waiting. The dataset has been developed to evaluate the heuristics of the MDVSP that are presented in “A new formulation and a column generation-based heuristic for the multiple depot vehicle sche- duling problem” (Kulkarni et al., 2018). The dataset contains 60 problem instances of varying size. Researchers can use the dataset to evaluate the future algorithms for the MDVSP and compare the performance with the existing algorithms. The dataset includes a program that can be used to generate new problem instances of the MDVSP.

   The dataset contains 60 different problem instances of the multiple depot vehicle scheduling pro- blem (MDVSP). Each problem instance is provided in a separate ﬁle. Each ﬁle is named as ‘RN-m-n-k.dat’, where ‘m’, ‘n’, and ‘k’ denote the number of depots, the number of trips, and the instance number for the size, ‘ðm;nÞ’, respectively. For example, the problem instance, ‘RN-8–1500-01.dat’, is the ﬁrst problem instance with 8 depots and 1500 trips. For the number of depots, m, we used three values, 8,12, and 16. The four values for the number of trips, n, are 1500, 2000, 2500, and 3000. For each size, ðm;nÞ, ﬁve instances are provided. The dataset can be downloaded from https://orlib.uqcloud.net.

   Our dataset provides start/end location and time of trips as well as the travel time between any two locations. The location and time information is required to model the MDVSP on a time-space network. The feasible connections and the cost of connections between the trips can be obtained as discussed in [3]. Thus, the dataset has all the information that is required to model the MDVSP on the time-space network (see [2]) as well as the connection-network (see [5]). The benchmark solutions for all the problem instances are presented in [3].
