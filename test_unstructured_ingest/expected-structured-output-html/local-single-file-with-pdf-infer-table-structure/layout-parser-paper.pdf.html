   Abstract. Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im- portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going eﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica- tions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de- tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti- zation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases. The library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.

A generalized learning-based framework dramatically reduces the need for the manual speciﬁcation of complicated rules, which is the status quo with traditional methods. DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and beneﬁt a broad spectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.

   However, there are several practical diﬃculties for taking advantages of re- cent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted for reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame- works like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can be obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and frustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA, and many researchers who would beneﬁt the most from using these methods lack the technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images contain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training is often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no full-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets and ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of models and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams use DL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes, and these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not documented at all). This makes it diﬃcult for research teams to learn about how full pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources in reinventing the DIA wheel.

   2 Related Work
  </h1>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="8153390c1bb8652313be64034531449e">
   Recently, various DL models and datasets have been developed for layout analysis tasks. The dhSegment [22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [20] for segmen- tation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster R-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used for identifying document elements [38] and detecting tables [30, 26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] have also been used in table detection [27]. However, these models are usually implemented individually and there is no uniﬁed framework to load and use such models.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="45d6d494603e84706884918c1f785c9f">
   There has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document image processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M relevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods or provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the OCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However, similar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [21], it is designed for analyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models. The DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF documents via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9 and Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models trained on layout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document Analysis and Exploitation (DAE) platform [15] and the DeepDIVA project [2] aim to improve the reproducibility of DIA methods (or DL models), yet they are not actively maintained. OCR engines like Tesseract [14], easyOCR11 and paddleOCR12 usually do not come with comprehensive functionalities for other DIA tasks like layout analysis.

   1 For each dataset, we train several models of diﬀerent sizes for diﬀerent needs (the trade-oﬀ between accuracy vs. computational cost). For “base model” and “large model”, we refer to using the ResNet 50 or ResNet 101 backbones [13], respectively. One can train models of diﬀerent architectures, like Faster R-CNN [28] (F) and Mask R-CNN [12] (M). For example, an F in the Large Model column indicates it has a Faster R-CNN model trained using the ResNet 101 backbone.

   3.1 Layout Detection Models
  </h1>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="bbcc10c2b92de0cbdce8629f18b0d7ad">
   In LayoutParser, a layout model takes a document image as an input and generates a list of rectangular boxes for the target content regions. Diﬀerent from traditional methods, it relies on deep convolutional neural networks rather than manually curated rules to identify content regions. It is formulated as an object detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and makes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection. LayoutParser, built upon Detectron2 [35], provides a minimal API that can perform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:

   LayoutParser provides a wealth of pre-trained model weights using various datasets covering diﬀerent languages, time periods, and document types. Due to domain shift [7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap- plied to target samples that are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the training dataset. As document structures and layouts vary greatly in diﬀerent domains, it is important to select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples. A semantic syntax is used for initializing the model weights in LayoutParser, using both the dataset name and model name lp://&lt;dataset-name&gt;/&lt;model-architecture-name&gt;.

  </h1>

   A critical feature of LayoutParser is the implementation of a series of data structures and operations that can be used to eﬃciently process and manipulate the layout elements. In document image analysis pipelines, various post-processing on the layout analysis model outputs is usually required to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Traditionally, this requires exporting DL model outputs and then loading the results into other pipelines. All model outputs from LayoutParser will be stored in carefully engineered data types optimized for further processing, which makes it possible to build an end-to-end document digitization pipeline within LayoutParser. There are three key components in the data structure, namely the Coordinate system, the TextBlock, and the Layout. They provide diﬀerent levels of abstraction for the layout data, and a set of APIs are supported for transformations or operations on these classes.

A Quadrilateral class is also implemented to support a more generalized representation of rectangular regions when the document is skewed or distorted, where the 4 corner points can be speciﬁed and a total of 8 degrees of freedom are supported. A wide collection of transformations like shift, pad, and scale, and operations like intersect, union, and is_in, are supported for these classes. Notably, it is common to separate a segment of the image and analyze it individually. LayoutParser provides full support for this scenario via image cropping operations crop_image and coordinate transformations like relative_to and condition_on that transform coordinates to and from their relative representations. We refer readers to Table 2 for a more detailed description of these operations13.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="3f620e1ad95cd446170613ed9d780853">
   Based on Coordinates, we implement the TextBlock class that stores both the positional and extra features of individual layout elements. It also supports specifying the reading orders via setting the parent ﬁeld to the index of the parent object. A Layout class is built that takes in a list of TextBlocks and supports processing the elements in batch. Layout can also be nested to support hierarchical layout structures. They support the same operations and transformations as the Coordinate classes, minimizing both learning and deployment eﬀort.

   LayoutParser provides a uniﬁed interface for existing OCR tools. Though there are many OCR tools available, they are usually conﬁgured diﬀerently with distinct APIs or protocols for using them. It can be ineﬃcient to add new OCR tools into an existing pipeline, and diﬃcult to make direct comparisons among the available tools to ﬁnd the best option for a particular project. To this end, LayoutParser builds a series of wrappers among existing OCR engines, and provides nearly the same syntax for using them. It supports a plug-and-play style of using OCR engines, making it eﬀortless to switch, evaluate, and compare diﬀerent OCR modules:

   The end goal of DIA is to transform the image-based document data into a structured database. LayoutParser supports exporting layout data into diﬀerent formats like JSON, csv, and will add the support for the METS/ALTO XML format 14 . It can also load datasets from layout analysis-speciﬁc formats like COCO [38] and the Page Format [25] for training layout models (Section 3.5).

   LayoutParser incorporates a toolkit optimized for annotating document lay- outs using object-level active learning [32]. With the help from a layout detection model trained along with labeling, only the most important layout objects within each image, rather than the whole image, are required for labeling. The rest of the regions are automatically annotated with high conﬁdence predictions from the layout detection model. This allows a layout dataset to be created more eﬃciently with only around 60% of the labeling budget.

  <p class="NarrativeText" id="c4ccf2cf2e7495668221cbe51534f90b">
   After the training dataset is curated, LayoutParser supports diﬀerent modes for training the layout models. Fine-tuning can be used for training models on a small newly-labeled dataset by initializing the model with existing pre-trained weights. Training from scratch can be helpful when the source dataset and target are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent and a large training set is available. However, as suggested in Studer et al.’s work[33], loading pre-trained weights on large-scale datasets like ImageNet [5], even from totally diﬀerent domains, can still boost model performance. Through the integrated API provided by LayoutParser, users can easily compare model performances on the benchmark datasets.

   Another focus of LayoutParser is promoting the reusability of layout detection models and full digitization pipelines. Similar to many existing deep learning libraries, LayoutParser comes with a community model hub for distributing layout models. End-users can upload their self-trained models to the model hub, and these models can be loaded into a similar interface as the currently available LayoutParser pre-trained models. For example, the model trained on the News Navigator dataset [17] has been incorporated in the model hub.

   Beyond DL models, LayoutParser also promotes the sharing of entire doc- ument digitization pipelines. For example, sometimes the pipeline requires the combination of multiple DL models to achieve better accuracy. Currently, pipelines are mainly described in academic papers and implementations are often not pub- licly available. To this end, the LayoutParser community platform also enables the sharing of layout pipelines to promote the discussion and reuse of techniques. For each shared pipeline, it has a dedicated project page, with links to the source code, documentation, and an outline of the approaches. A discussion panel is provided for exchanging ideas. Combined with the core LayoutParser library, users can easily build reusable components based on the shared pipelines and apply them to solve their unique problems.

   The digitization of historical documents can unlock valuable data that can shed light on many important social, economic, and historical questions.

   In this example, LayoutParser was used to develop a comprehensive pipeline, shown in Figure 5, to gener- ate high-quality structured data from historical Japanese ﬁrm ﬁnancial ta- bles with complicated layouts. The pipeline applies two layout models to identify diﬀerent levels of document structures and two customized OCR engines for optimized character recog- nition accuracy.

   As shown in Figure 4 (a), the document contains columns of text written vertically 15, a common style in Japanese. Due to scanning noise and archaic printing technology, the columns can be skewed or have vari- able widths, and hence cannot be eas- ily identiﬁed via rule-based methods. Within each column, words are sepa- rated by white spaces of variable size, and the vertical positions of objects can be an indicator of their layout type.

   structure, two object detection models have been trained to recognize individual columns and tokens, respectively. A small training set (400 images with approxi- mately 100 annotations each) is curated via the active learning based annotation tool [32] in LayoutParser. The models learn to identify both the categories and regions for each token or column via their distinct visual features. The layout data structure enables easy grouping of the tokens within each column, and rearranging columns to achieve the correct reading orders based on the horizontal position. Errors are identiﬁed and rectiﬁed via checking the consistency of the model predictions. Therefore, though trained on a small dataset, the pipeline achieves a high level of layout detection accuracy: it achieves a 96.97 AP [19] score across 5 categories for the column detection model, and a 89.23 AP across 4 categories for the token detection model.

   A combination of character recognition methods is developed to tackle the unique challenges in this document. In our experiments, we found that irregular spacing between the tokens led to a low character recognition recall rate, whereas existing OCR models tend to perform better on densely-arranged texts. To overcome this challenge, we create a document reorganization algorithm that rearranges the text based on the token bounding boxes detected in the layout analysis step. Figure 4 (b) illustrates the generated image of dense text, which is sent to the OCR APIs as a whole to reduce the transaction costs. The ﬂexible coordinate system in LayoutParser is used to transform the OCR results relative to their original positions on the page.

   Additionally, it is common for historical documents to use unique fonts with diﬀerent glyphs, which signiﬁcantly degrades the accuracy of OCR models trained on modern texts. In this document, a special ﬂat font is used for printing numbers and could not be detected by oﬀ-the-shelf OCR engines. Using the highly ﬂexible functionalities from LayoutParser, a pipeline approach is constructed that achieves a high recognition accuracy with minimal eﬀort. As the characters have unique visual structures and are usually clustered together, we train the layout model to identify number regions with a dedicated category. Subsequently, LayoutParser crops images within these regions, and identiﬁes characters within them using a self-trained OCR model based on a CNN-RNN [6]. The model detects a total of 15 possible categories, and achieves a 0.98 Jaccard score16 and a 0.17 average Levinstein distances17 for token prediction on the test set.

   Overall, it is possible to create an intricate and highly accurate digitization pipeline for large-scale digitization using LayoutParser.

   Detecting tables and parsing their structures (table extraction) are of central im- portance for many document digitization tasks. Many previous works [26, 30, 27] and tools 18 have been developed to identify and parse table structures. Yet they might require training complicated models from scratch, or are only applicable for born-digital PDF documents. In this section, we show how LayoutParser can help build a light-weight accurate visual table extractor for legal docket tables using the existing resources with minimal eﬀort.
  </p>
  <p class="NarrativeText" id="923b62eb8550ec49cf6d3f2e6bac7ec8">
   The extractor uses a pre-trained layout detection model for identifying the table regions and some simple rules for pairing the rows and the columns in the PDF image. Mask R-CNN [12] trained on the PubLayNet dataset [38] from the LayoutParser Model Zoo can be used for detecting table regions. By ﬁltering out model predictions of low conﬁdence and removing overlapping predictions, LayoutParser can identify the tabular regions on each page, which signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the subsequent steps. By applying the line detection functions within the tabular segments, provided in the utility module from LayoutParser, the pipeline can identify the three distinct columns in the tables. A row clustering method is then applied via analyzing the y coordinates of token bounding boxes in the left-most column, which are obtained from the OCR engines. A non-maximal suppression algorithm is used to remove duplicated rows with extremely small gaps. Shown in Figure 6, the built pipeline can detect tables at diﬀerent positions on a page accurately. Continued tables from diﬀerent pages are concatenated, and a structured table representation has been easily created.
