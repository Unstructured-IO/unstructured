Casinos use Proprietary Table Games together with or in lieu of other games in the public domain (e.g. Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, etc.) because of their popularity with players and to increase profitability. Typically, Proprietary Table Games are grouped into two product types referred to as “Side Bets” and “Premium Games.” Side Bets are proprietary features and wagering options typically added to public domain games such as baccarat, pai gow poker, craps and blackjack table games. Examples of our Side Bets include 21+3®, Lucky Ladies® and Bonus Craps™. Premium Games are unique stand-alone games with their own set of rules and strategies. Examples of our Premium Games include Heads Up Hold ’em®, High Card Flush®, Cajun Stud® and Three Card Poker®. Generally, Premium Games generate higher revenue per table placement than the Side Bet games."

These tribes generally require suppliers of gaming and gaming-related equipment to obtain authorizations. Gaming on Native American lands within the United States is governed by the Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (“IGRA”) and specific tribal ordinances and regulations. Class III gaming (table games and slot machines, for example), as defined under IGRA, also requires a Tribal-State Compact, which is a written agreement between a specific tribe and the respective state. This compact authorizes the type of Class III gaming activity and the standards, procedures and controls under which the Class III gaming activity must be conducted. The National Indian Gaming Commission (“NIGC”) has oversight authority over gaming on Native American lands and generally monitors tribal gaming, including the establishment and enforcement of required minimum internal control standards. Each tribe is sovereign and must have a tribal gaming commission or office established to regulate tribal gaming activity to ensure compliance with IGRA, NIGC, and its Tribal-State Compact. We have complied with each of the numerous vendor licensing, specific product approvals and shipping notification requirements imposed by Tribal-State Compacts and enforced by tribal and/or state gaming agencies under IGRA in the Native American lands in which we do business."

The increase in total current assets as of December 31, 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the accounts receivable balance, resulting from higher billings and lower collections directly related to the COVID-19 crisis. Also, the Company entered into the Fortress Credit Agreement on November 15, 2021, which provided $5,273,464 in cash to the Company, after settlement of the NSB Term Loan, the Revolving Loan, the MSPLP and the Triangulum promissory note. See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Information” for further details. The increase in total assets as of December 31, 2021 was offset by amortization on the Company’s long-term other intangible assets."

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Basis for Opinion</td><td></td><td>These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Critical Audit Matters</td><td></td><td>Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>/s/</td><td>Moss Adams LLP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>San Diego, California</td><td></td><td>March

    "text": "To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors \n Galaxy Gaming, Inc. \n   \n Opinion on the Financial Statements \n We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Galaxy Gaming, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n   \n Basis for Opinion \n These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n   \n We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n   \n Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n   \n Critical Audit Matters \n Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. \n   \n /s/  Moss Adams LLP \n   \n San Diego, California \n March 30, 2022 \n   \n We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020"

When Saucier filed a supplemental motion for attorneys’ fees, the Nevada district court denied his motion, finding the fees incurred to be unreasonable, among other things.

Other than the foregoing, there are no stated minimum criteria for director nominees, although the Board may also consider such other factors as it may deem are in our best interests as well as our stockholders. In addition, the Board identifies nominees by first evaluating the current members of the Board willing to continue in service. Current members of the Board with skills and experience that are relevant to our business and who are willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination. If any member of the Board does not wish to continue in service or if the Board decides not to re-nominate a member for re-election, the Board then identifies the desired skills and experience of a new nominee in light of the criteria above. Current members of the Board are polled for suggestions as to individuals meeting the criteria described above. The Board may also engage in research to identify qualified individuals. To date, we have not engaged third parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying potential nominees, although we reserve the right in the future to retain a third-party search firm, if necessary. The Board does not typically consider shareholder nominees because it believes that our current nomination process is sufficient to identify directors who serve our best interests."
