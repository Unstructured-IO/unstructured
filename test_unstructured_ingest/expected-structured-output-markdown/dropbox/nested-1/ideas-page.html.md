<table><tr><td/><td/><td>January 2023 ( Someone fed my essays into GPT to make something that could answer<br/>questions based on them, then asked it where good ideas come from. The<br/>answer was ok, but not what I would have said. This is what I would have said.) The way to get new ideas is to notice anomalies: what seems strange,<br/>or missing, or broken? You can see anomalies in everyday life (much<br/>of standup comedy is based on this), but the best place to look for<br/>them is at the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge grows fractally.<br/>From a distance its edges look smooth, but when you learn enough<br/>to get close to one, you&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;s full of gaps. These gaps<br/>will seem obvious; it will seem inexplicable that no one has tried<br/>x or wondered about y. In the best case, exploring such gaps yields<br/>whole new fractal buds.</td></tr></table>
