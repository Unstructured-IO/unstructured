For example, a party might send a request to alter (establish) line length.

It should be transmitted at those times, and only at those times, when the user should be given control of the terminal.

If the AO were received during the transmission of the text string, a reasonable implementation would be to suppress the remainder of the text string, but transmit the prompt character and the preceding <CR><LF>.

(For example, some terminals do not have a CR independent of the LF, but on such terminals it may be possible to simulate a CR by backspacing.) Therefore, the sequence \"CR LF\" must be treated as a single \"new line\" character and used whenever their combined action is intended; the sequence \"CR NUL\" must be used where a carriage return alone is actually desired; and the CR character must be avoided in other contexts. This rule gives assurance to systems which must decide whether to perform a \"new line\" function or a multiple-backspace that the TELNET stream contains a character following a CR that will allow a rational decision."
