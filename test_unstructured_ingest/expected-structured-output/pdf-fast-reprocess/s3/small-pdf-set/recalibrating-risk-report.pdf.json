The fear of radiation, whilst pre- dating the Second World War, was firmly established by the debate on the potential impacts of low-dose radiation from the fallout from nuclear weapons testing in the early years of the Cold War. Radiation in many ways became linked with the mental imagery of nuclear war, playing an important role in increasing public concern about radiation and its health effects. There is a well-established discrepancy between fact-based risk assessments and public perception of different risks. This is very much the case with nuclear power, and this is clearly highlighted in Figure 1, with laypersons ranking nuclear power as the highest risk out of 30 activities and technologies, with experts ranking nuclear as 20th. In many ways, popular culture’s depiction of radiation has played a role in ensuring that this discrepancy has remained, be it Godzilla, The Incredible Hulk, or The Simpsons, which regularly plays on the notion of radiation from nuclear power plants causing three-eyed fish, something that has been firmly rejected as unscientific.",

    "text": "In reality, radiation is a natural part of life; indeed, we are all exposed to radiation every day, on average receiving 2-3 millisieverts (mSv) per year. Most of this radiation is naturally occurring, with radon gas from the ground being the main source of exposure. The nuclear industry is responsible for a very small part of radiation exposure to the public, as seen in Figure 2. To put this into perspective, eating 10 bananas or two Brazil nuts results in the same radiation dose as living nearby a nuclear power plant for a year. Humans are also naturally radioactive, and the radiation dose from sleeping next to someone else each night for a year is ten times higher than the exposure from living nearby a nuclear power plant for the same time span.",

A 2016 reportiii from the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) found that coal-generated electricity is responsible for more than half of the total global radiation exposure arising from electricity generation, while nuclear power contributed less than a fifth. Coal miners received high occupational exposure and workers in solar and wind farms received the highest occupational exposure associated with plant construction for the same amount of installed capacity.",

Assuming that LNT is correct, we should expect to see that people living in areas of the world where background doses are higher (e.g. India, Iran and northern Europe) have a higher incidence of cancer. However, despite people living in areas of the world where radiation doses are naturally higher than those that would be received in parts of the evacuation zones around Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi, there is no evidence that these populations exhibit any negative health effects. Living nearby a nuclear power plant on average exposes the local population to 0.00009mSv/year, which according to LNT would increase the risk of developing cancer by 0.00000045%. After Chernobyl, the average dose to those evacuated was 30mSv, which would theoretically increase the risk of cancer at some point in their lifetime by 0.15% (on top of the average baseline lifetime risk of cancer, which is 39.5% in the USviii, 50% in the UKix).",

In the context of nuclear power, this means departing from the notion that LNT instils of no safe level of radiation, and adopting a regulatory framework which notes the impossibility of eradicating risks.

Indeed, several of these issues have been considerably exacerbated by the fact that certain risks are given a disproportionate amount of focus, whereas others are de facto ignored. The global conversation around climate change is a prime example of this. The historical use of fossil fuels has contributed significantly to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions, causing unprecedented changes in the liveability of the Earth. By 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas, as extreme heat and droughts are exacerbating water resources. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to be the cause of an additional 250,000 deaths per year, arising from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stressx. Yet, despite the huge risks associated with climate change, our addiction to coal, oil, and fossil gas remains, with fossil fuels providing 84% of global primary energy in 2019xii. The continued prioritization of fossil fuels at the expense of nuclear energy results in a considerable increase in the risks posed by climate change.",

The world's poorest 4 billion people consume a mere 5% of the energy used in developed economies, and we need to find ways of delivering reliable electricity to the entire human population in a fashion that is sustainable.
