Further, just as the mapping for 124 (174 octal) is somewhat arbitrary in an environment that has no \"vertical bar\" character, the EL character may have a somewhat arbitrary mapping (or none at all) if there is no local \"Erase Line\" facility. Similarly for format effectors:  if the terminal actually does have a \"Vertical Tab\", then the mapping for VT is obvious, and only when the terminal does not have a vertical tab should the effect of VT be unpredictable.",
