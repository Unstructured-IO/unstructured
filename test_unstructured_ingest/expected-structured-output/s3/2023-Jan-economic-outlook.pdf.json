The sources of these surprises were in many cases domestic: stronger-than-expected private consumption and investment amid tight labor markets and greater-than-anticipated fiscal support. Households spent more to satisfy pent-up demand, particularly on services, partly by drawing down their stock of savings as economies reopened. Business investment rose to meet demand. On the supply side, easing bottlenecks and declining transportation costs reduced pressures on input prices and allowed for a rebound in previously constrained sectors, such as motor vehicles. Energy markets have adjusted faster than expected to the shock from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",

Renewed lockdowns accompanied the outbreaks until the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in November and December, which paved the way for a full reopening. Real estate investment continued to contract, and developer restructuring is proceeding slowly, amid the lingering property market crisis. Developers have yet to deliver on a large backlog of presold housing, and downward pressure is building on house prices (so far limited by home price floors). The authorities have responded with additional monetary and fiscal policy easing, new vaccination targets for the elderly, and steps to support the completion of unfinished real estate projects. However, consumer and business sentiment remained subdued in late 2022. China’s slowdown has reduced global trade growth and international commodity prices.",

    "text": "Monetary policy starts to bite. Signs are apparent that monetary policy tightening is starting to cool demand and inflation, but the full impact is unlikely to be realized before 2024. Global headline inflation appears to have peaked in the third quarter of 2022 (Figure 1). Prices of fuel and nonfuel commodities have declined, lowering headline inflation, notably in the United States, the euro area, and Latin America. But underlying (core) inflation has not yet peaked in most economies and remains well above pre-pandemic levels. It has persisted amid second-round effects from earlier cost shocks and tight labor markets with robust wage growth as consumer demand has remained resilient. Medium-term inflation expectations generally remain anchored, but some gauges are up. These developments have caused central banks to raise rates faster than expected, especially in the United States and the euro area, and to signal that rates will stay elevated for longer. Core inflation is declining in some economies that have completed their tightening cycle—such as Brazil. Financial markets are displaying high sensitivity to inflation news, with equity markets rising following recent releases of lower inflation data in anticipation of interest rate cuts (Box 1), despite central banks’ communicating their resolve to tighten policy further. With the peak in US headline inflation and an acceleration in rate hikes by several non-US central banks, the dollar has weakened since September but remains significantly stronger than a year ago.",

Gas prices have declined by more than expected amid higher non-Russian pipeline and liquefied natural gas flows, compression of demand for gas, and a warmer-than-usual winter. However, the boost from reopening appears to be fading. High-frequency indicators for the fourth quarter suggest that the manufacturing and services sectors are contracting. Consumer confidence and business sentiment have worsened. With inflation at about 10 percent or above in several euro area countries and the United Kingdom, household budgets remain stretched. The accelerated pace of rate increases by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank is tightening financial conditions and cooling demand in the housing sector and beyond.",

Raising real policy rates and keeping them above their neutral levels until underlying inflation is clearly declining would ward off risks of inflation expectations de- anchoring. Clear central bank communication and appropriate reactions to shifts in the data will help keep inflation expectations anchored and lessen wage and price pressures. Central banks’ balance sheets will need to be unwound carefully, amid market liquidity risks. Gradual and steady fiscal tightening would contribute to cooling demand and limit the burden on monetary policy in the fight against inflation. In countries where output remains below potential and inflation is in check, maintaining monetary and fiscal accommodation may be appropriate.",

    "text": "Overall, financial stability risks remain elevated as investors reassess their inflation and monetary policy outlook. Global financial conditions have eased somewhat since the October 2022 Global Financial Stability Report, driven largely by changing market expectations regarding the interest rate cycle (Figure 1.1). While the expected peak in policy rates—the terminal rate—has risen, markets now also expect the subsequent fall in rates will be significantly faster, and further, than what was forecast in October (Figure 1.2). As a result, global bond yields have recently declined, corporate spreads have tightened, and equity markets have rebounded. That said, central banks are likely to continue to tighten monetary policy to fight inflation, and concerns that this restrictive stance could tip the economy into a recession have increased in major advanced economies.",

    "text": "Slowing aggregate demand and weaker-than-expected inflation prints in some major advanced economies have prompted investors’ anticipation of a further reduction in the pace of future policy rate hikes. Corporate earnings forecasts have been cut due to headwinds from slowing demand, and margins have contracted across most regions. In addition, survey-based probabilities of recession have been increasing, particularly in the United States and Europe. However, upside risks to the inflation outlook remain. Despite the recent moderation in headline inflation, core inflation remains stubbornly high across most regions, labor markets are still tight, energy prices remain pressured by Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, and supply chain disruptions may reappear. To keep these risks in check, financial conditions will likely need to tighten further. If not, central banks may need to increase policy rates even more in order to achieve their inflation objectives.",

Risk assets could face significant declines if earnings retrench further or if investors reassess their outlook for monetary policy given central bank communications. Globally, the partial reversal of the dollar rally has contributed to recent easing due to improved risk appetite, and some emerging market central banks have paused tightening amid tentative signs that inflation may have peaked.",
