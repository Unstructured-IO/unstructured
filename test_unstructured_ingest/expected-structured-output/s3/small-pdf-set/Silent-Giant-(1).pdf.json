The health, environmental and safety benefits of nuclear energy are not sufficiently understood and valued when compared with other electricity sources. Nuclear energy remains the safest form of electricity generation (Figure 4). Additionally, the use of nuclear consistently prevents many tens of thousands of deaths (mainly resulting from air pollution) every year by avoiding the use of coal - lifesaving measures which must be better recognised and valued."
