Despite the many benefits of nuclear energy, its deployment is hindered in some parts of the world due to long-standing misconceptions about its risks. Even with its safety record – unmatched by any other energy source – the perception of nuclear power as uniquely dangerous endures."

This has resulted in higher costs, without delivering any additional health benefits, and has resulted in policymakers choosing other, more risky energy sources. More often than not, those alternative energy sources have been fossil fuels, greatly exacerbating the well-known risks posed by air pollution and climate change."

    "text": "It is widely accepted that humans have skewed perceptions of risks, and the way we respond to them is shaped by these perceptions, rather than the actual threats posed. Approximately 1.35 millioni people die every year because of traffic accidents, in comparison with 257 aviation fatalities in 2019ii, yet more people are nervous about flying, fearing a rare deadly crash, than being in a fatal traffic accident. These numbers tell a powerful and well-established story: evaluations of risk are largely the result of emotions, rather than logic or facts. Although it is hard to recognize and accept that our perceptions may mislead us and curtail effective decision making, this is a well-established characteristic of humanity."

    "text": "Nuclear energy and the risk of radiation is one of the most extreme cases in which perceived and actual risks have diverged. The fear of radiation, whilst pre- dating the Second World War, was firmly established by the debate on the potential impacts of low-dose radiation from the fallout from nuclear weapons testing in the early years of the Cold War. Radiation in many ways became linked with the mental imagery of nuclear war, playing an important role in increasing public concern about radiation and its health effects. There is a well-established discrepancy between fact-based risk assessments and public perception of different risks. This is very much the case with nuclear power, and this is clearly highlighted in Figure 1, with laypersons ranking nuclear power as the highest risk out of 30 activities and technologies, with experts ranking nuclear as 20th. In many ways, popular culture’s depiction of radiation has played a role in ensuring that this discrepancy has remained, be it Godzilla, The Incredible Hulk, or The Simpsons, which regularly plays on the notion of radiation from nuclear power plants causing three-eyed fish, something that has been firmly rejected as unscientific."

    "text": "In reality, radiation is a natural part of life; indeed, we are all exposed to radiation every day, on average receiving 2-3 millisieverts (mSv) per year. Most of this radiation is naturally occurring, with radon gas from the ground being the main source of exposure. The nuclear industry is responsible for a very small part of radiation exposure to the public, as seen in Figure 2. To put this into perspective, eating 10 bananas or two Brazil nuts results in the same radiation dose as living nearby a nuclear power plant for a year. Humans are also naturally radioactive, and the radiation dose from sleeping next to someone else each night for a year is ten times higher than the exposure from living nearby a nuclear power plant for the same time span."

A 2016 reportiii from the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) found that coal-generated electricity is responsible for more than half of the total global radiation exposure arising from electricity generation, while nuclear power contributed less than a fifth. Coal miners received high occupational exposure and workers in solar and wind farms received the highest occupational exposure associated with plant construction for the same amount of installed capacity."

    "text": "Since the 1950s, the Linear No-Threshold (LNT) theory has been used to inform regulatory decisions, positing that any dose of radiation, regardless of the amount or the duration over which it is received, poses a risk. Assuming that LNT is correct, we should expect to see that people living in areas of the world where background doses are higher (e.g. India, Iran and northern Europe) have a higher incidence of cancer. However, despite people living in areas of the world where radiation doses are naturally higher than those that would be received in parts of the evacuation zones around Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi, there is no evidence that these populations exhibit any negative health effects. Living nearby a nuclear power plant on average exposes the local population to 0.00009mSv/year, which according to LNT would increase the risk of developing cancer by 0.00000045%. After Chernobyl, the average dose to those evacuated was 30mSv, which would theoretically increase the risk of cancer at some point in their lifetime by 0.15% (on top of the average baseline lifetime risk of cancer, which is 39.5% in the USviii, 50% in the UKix)."

Indeed, the Chernobyl accident helped illuminate some of the issues associated with LNT. Multiplication of the low doses after the accident (many far too low to be of any health concern) with large populations – using the assumptions made by LNT – led to a large number of predicted cancer deaths, which have not, and likely will not materialize. This practice has been heavily criticized for being inappropriate in making risk assessments by UNSCEAR, the International Commission on Radiation Protection and a large number of independent scientists."

Attempting to reduce radiation far below de facto safe levels has resulted in an escalation of costs and loss of public confidence, and in some cases has deprived communities of the many benefits nuclear energy provides. In practical terms, this has led to the continued use of more harmful energy sources, such as fossil fuels."

We therefore must not look at the costs – be they economic, environmental, or public health – associated with an individual power plant in isolation, but rather the costs associated with it (and its alternatives) at a societal level (Figure 4). This would entail looking at the potential risks arising from the use of nuclear power and comparing these with the risks associated with not adopting nuclear power."

    "text": "By looking at radiation risks in isolation, we have created something akin to a “radiation phobia”, that both directly and indirectly harms people around the world. For instance, it is well established that the vast majority of health impacts from Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi were not radiological, but rather psychosocial. There has been an observable and dramatic increase in depression, PTSD, substance abuse, and suicides following these events, which can be significantly attributed to the dissonance between the actual and perceived risks of radiation, and the stigmatization they caused."

    "text": "Similarly, many of the tremendous challenges the global community faces are significantly driven by this “radiation phobia”. Indeed, several of these issues have been considerably exacerbated by the fact that certain risks are given a disproportionate amount of focus, whereas others are de facto ignored. The global conversation around climate change is a prime example of this. The historical use of fossil fuels has contributed significantly to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions, causing unprecedented changes in the liveability of the Earth. By 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas, as extreme heat and droughts are exacerbating water resources. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to be the cause of an additional 250,000 deaths per year, arising from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stressx. Yet, despite the huge risks associated with climate change, our addiction to coal, oil, and fossil gas remains, with fossil fuels providing 84% of global primary energy in 2019xii. The continued prioritization of fossil fuels at the expense of nuclear energy results in a considerable increase in the risks posed by climate change."

    "text": "Equally, it is well established that living without access to electricity results in illness and death around the world, caused by everything from not having access to modern healthcare to household air pollution. As of today, 770 million people around the world do not have access to electricity, with over 75% of that population living in Sub-Saharan Africa. The world's poorest 4 billion people consume a mere 5% of the energy used in developed economies, and we need to find ways of delivering reliable electricity to the entire human population in a fashion that is sustainable. Household and ambient air pollution causes 8.7 million deaths each year, largely because of the continued use of fossil fuels. Widespread electrification is a key tool for delivering a just energy transition. Investment in nuclear, has become an urgent necessity. Discarding it, based on risk perceptions divorced from science, would be to abandon the moral obligation to ensure affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for every community around the world."

The detrimental effects of decades of looking at nuclear risks in isolation highlights just how crucial it is that regulators and policymakers change the way they view nuclear energy, and transition towards an all-hazards approach, ensuring that actions taken to mitigate risks do not result in creating more severe risks."
