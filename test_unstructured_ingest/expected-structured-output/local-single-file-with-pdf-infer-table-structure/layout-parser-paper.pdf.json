    "text": "Abstract. Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model configurations complicate the easy reuse of im- portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going efforts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica- tions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de- tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti- zation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases. The library is publicly available at https: //layout-parser . github. io|"

Existing models are developed using distinct frame- works like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch be obfuscated by implementation details and the high-level parameters can . It can be a time-consuming and frustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA, and many researchers who would benefit the most from using these methods lack the technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images contain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training is often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no full-fledged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets and fine-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of models and other processing to obtain the final outputs. Often research teams use DL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes, and these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not documented at all). This makes it difficult for research teams to learn about how full pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest significant resources in reinventing the DIA wheel."

A Quadrilateral class is also implemented to support a more generalized representation of rectangular regions when the document is skewed or distorted, where the 4 corner points can be specified and a total of 8 degrees of freedom are supported. A wide collection of transformations ike shift, pad, and scale, and operations like intersect, union, and is_in, are supported for these classes. Notably, it is common to separate a segment of the image and analyze it individually.

By filtering out model predictions of low confidence and removing overlapping predictions, LayoutParser can identify the tabular regions on each page, which significantly simplifies the subsequent steps. By applying the line detection functions within he tabular segments, provided in the utility module from LayoutParser, the pipeline can identify the three distinct columns in the tables. A row clustering method is then applied via analyzing the y coordinates of token bounding boxes in he left-most column, which are obtained from the OCR engines. A non-maximal suppression algorithm is used to remove duplicated rows with extremely small gaps. Shown in Figure|6} the built pipeline can detect tables at different positions on a page accurately. Continued tables from different pages are concatenated, and a structured table representation has been easily created."
