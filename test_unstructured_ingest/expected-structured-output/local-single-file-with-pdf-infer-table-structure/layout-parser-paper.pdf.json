    "text": "Abstract. Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im- portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going eﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica- tions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de- tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti- zation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases. The library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.",

    "text": "However, there are several practical diﬃculties for taking advantages of re- cent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted for reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame- works like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can be obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and frustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA, and many researchers who would beneﬁt the most from using these methods lack the technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images contain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training is often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no full-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets and ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of models and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams use DL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes, and these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not documented at all). This makes it diﬃcult for research teams to learn about how full pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources in reinventing the DIA wheel.",

The closest prior research to our work is the OCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However, similar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al.

The DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF documents via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9 and Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models trained on layout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document Analysis and Exploitation (DAE) platform [15] and the DeepDIVA project [2] aim to improve the reproducibility of DIA methods (or DL models), yet they are not actively maintained.

In document image analysis pipelines, various post-processing on the layout analysis model outputs is usually required to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Traditionally, this requires exporting DL model outputs and then loading the results into other pipelines. All model outputs from LayoutParser will be stored in carefully engineered data types optimized for further processing, which makes it possible to build an end-to-end document digitization pipeline within LayoutParser. There are three key components in the data structure, namely the Coordinate system, the TextBlock, and the Layout. They provide diﬀerent levels of abstraction for the layout data, and a set of APIs are supported for transformations or operations on these classes.",

Interval and Rectangle are the most common data types and support specifying 1D or 2D regions within a document. They are parameterized with 2 and 4 parameters. A Quadrilateral class is also implemented to support a more generalized representation of rectangular regions when the document is skewed or distorted, where the 4 corner points can be speciﬁed and a total of 8 degrees of freedom are supported. A wide collection of transformations like shift, pad, and scale, and operations like intersect, union, and is_in, are supported for these classes. Notably, it is common to separate a segment of the image and analyze it individually. LayoutParser provides full support for this scenario via image cropping operations crop_image and coordinate transformations like relative_to and condition_on that transform coordinates to and from their relative representations. We refer readers to Table 2 for a more detailed description of these operations13.",

A small training set (400 images with approxi- mately 100 annotations each) is curated via the active learning based annotation tool [32] in LayoutParser. The models learn to identify both the categories and regions for each token or column via their distinct visual features. The layout data structure enables easy grouping of the tokens within each column, and rearranging columns to achieve the correct reading orders based on the horizontal position. Errors are identiﬁed and rectiﬁed via checking the consistency of the model predictions. Therefore, though trained on a small dataset, the pipeline achieves a high level of layout detection accuracy: it achieves a 96.97 AP [19] score across 5 categories for the column detection model, and a 89.23 AP across 4 categories for the token detection model.",

In our experiments, we found that irregular spacing between the tokens led to a low character recognition recall rate, whereas existing OCR models tend to perform better on densely-arranged texts. To overcome this challenge, we create a document reorganization algorithm that rearranges the text based on the token bounding boxes detected in the layout analysis step. Figure 4 (b) illustrates the generated image of dense text, which is sent to the OCR APIs as a whole to reduce the transaction costs. The ﬂexible coordinate system in LayoutParser is used to transform the OCR results relative to their original positions on the page.",

In this document, a special ﬂat font is used for printing numbers and could not be detected by oﬀ-the-shelf OCR engines. Using the highly ﬂexible functionalities from LayoutParser, a pipeline approach is constructed that achieves a high recognition accuracy with minimal eﬀort. As the characters have unique visual structures and are usually clustered together, we train the layout model to identify number regions with a dedicated category. Subsequently, LayoutParser crops images within these regions, and identiﬁes characters within them using a self-trained OCR model based on a CNN-RNN [6]. The model detects a total of 15 possible categories, and achieves a 0.98 Jaccard score16 and a 0.17 average Levinstein distances17 for token prediction on the test set.",

By ﬁltering out model predictions of low conﬁdence and removing overlapping predictions, LayoutParser can identify the tabular regions on each page, which signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the subsequent steps. By applying the line detection functions within the tabular segments, provided in the utility module from LayoutParser, the pipeline can identify the three distinct columns in the tables. A row clustering method is then applied via analyzing the y coordinates of token bounding boxes in the left-most column, which are obtained from the OCR engines. A non-maximal suppression algorithm is used to remove duplicated rows with extremely small gaps. Shown in Figure 6, the built pipeline can detect tables at diﬀerent positions on a page accurately. Continued tables from diﬀerent pages are concatenated, and a structured table representation has been easily created.",
