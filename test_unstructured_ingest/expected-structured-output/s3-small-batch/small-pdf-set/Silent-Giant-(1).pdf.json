Clearly, the sun does not always shine, and the wind does not always blow, and this is compounded by the fact that many times these periods coincide with when electricity demand is at its highest, but renewables can be complementary to nuclear energy. Storage solutions, such as batteries, will not be able to power our societies for days or weeks when the weather is not favourable.
