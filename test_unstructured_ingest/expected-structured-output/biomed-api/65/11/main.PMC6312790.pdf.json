In this data article, a comprehensive effect of waste product and optimized process parameter of the inhibitor in 0.5M H SO solution was presented using weight loss and potentiody- 2 4 namic polarization techniques. The presence of the inhibitor (egg shell powder) influenced corrosion resistance of stainless steel. Inhibition efficiency value of 94.74% was recorded as a result of inhibition of the steel by the ionized molecules of the inhibiting compound of the egg shell powder influencing the redox mechan- ism reactions responsible for corrosion and surface deterioration."

Fig. 4 shows the cathodic and anodic polarization curves for stainless steel in 0.5 M H SO solution at different ES concentrations. 2 4 The electrochemical variables such as polarization resistance (PR), corrosion potential (Ecorr), cor- rosion current (icorr), anodic Tafel constant (ba), cathodic Tafel constant (bc) and corrosion rate (mm/ year) values are presented in Table 1. From the polarization curves and electrochemical parameter, icorr value decreased with the addition of inhibitor in 0.5 M H SO . Conversely, the icorr further 2 4 decrease with an increase in inhibitor concentration indicating that the inhibition effects increase with an increase in the egg shell concentration. The process of egg shell inhibition could be attributed to the formation of egg shell powder adsorbed on stainless steel surface protecting corrosion of stainless steel in H SO medium. The likely mechanism is the egg shell adsorption on stainless steel 2 4 surface through the heteroatoms electron pair and the conjugated systems in egg shell molecular structure as shown in Fig. 1. When the concentration of inhibitor was increased from 2 to 10 g, the corrosion rate values drastically decreased this result show that waste egg shell powder is an effective corrosion inhibitor for stainless steel in H SO solution. The shift in corrosion potential of stainless 2 4 steel from Tafel curves and electrochemical data indicate that the inhibitor is a mixed-type corrosion"

The cleaned and weighed specimen was suspended in beakers with the aid of glass hooks and rods with the test solution of ES at different concentration (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 g). The pre-weighed specimen was retrieved from the test solution after every 24 h, cleaned, dried and reweighed. The difference between the weight at a given time and the initial weight of the specimen was taken as the weight loss which was used to calculate corrosion rate and inhibition efficiency."
