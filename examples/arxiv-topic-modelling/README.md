## arXiv Topic Modelling

This directory contains an example of how to use the arXiv python package (wrapper for the arXiv api), berTopic python package (transformer based topic modelling)
and several bricks from the `unstructured` library to run topic modelling on queried arXiV research papers. This notebook is very simple, but can easily modified for more complicated use cases.

To get started, use the following steps:

- Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system
- Create a new Python virtual environment
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies
- Run `PYTHONPATH=. jupyter notebook` from this directory to launch the notebook

At this point, you'll be able to run the topic modelling example notebook.
