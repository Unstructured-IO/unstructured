    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll cut right to the chase and get to the most important part of the library: partitioning a document. The goal of document partitioning is to read in a source document, split the document into sections, categorize those sections, and extract the text associated with those sections. Depending on the document type, `unstructured` uses different methods for partitioning a document. We'll cover those in a later training notebook. For now, we'll use the simplest API in the library, the `partition` function. The `partition` function will detect the filetype of the source document and route it to the appropriate partitioning function. You can try out the `partition` function by running the cell below."

We have elected to recognize compensation expense for all options with graded vesting on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire option. The determination of fair value using the Black-Scholes pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables, including expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. We estimate volatility based on historical volatility of our common stock, and estimate the expected term based on several criteria, including the vesting period of the grant and the term of the award.

We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”) using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. These temporary differences will result in deductible or taxable amounts in future years when the reported amounts of the assets or liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized. Adjustments to the valuation allowance increase or decrease our income tax provision or benefit. To the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. As of December\\xa031, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a full valuation allowance against certain deferred assets.',\n",
