    "In this section, we'll cut right to the chase and get to the most important part of the library: partitioning a document. The goal of document partitioning is to read in a source document, split the document into sections, categorize those sections, and extract the text associated with those sections. Depending on the document type, `unstructured` uses different methods for partitioning a document. We'll cover those in a later training notebook. For now, we'll use the simplest API in the library, the `partition` function. The `partition` function will detect the filetype of the source document and route it to the appropriate partitioning function. You can try out the `partition` function by running the cell below."
