There are three types of bricks in `unstructured`, corresponding to the different stages of document pre-processing: partitioning, cleaning, and staging. At the conclusion of this notebook, you should be able to do the following:\n",

    "Partitioning bricks in `unstructured` allow users to extract structured content from a raw unstructured document. As we covered in the [core concepts notebook](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/blob/main/examples/training/0-Core%20Concepts.ipynb), partitioning bricks break a document down into elements such as `Title`, `NarrativeText`, and `ListItem`, enabling users to decide what content they'd like to keep for their particular application. If you're training a summarization model, for example, you may only be interested in `NarrativeText`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to partition documents in `unstructured` is to use the `partition` brick. If you call the `partition` brick, `unstructured` will use `libmagic` to automatically determine the file type and invoke the appropriate `partition` function. As shown in the examples below, the `partition` function accepts both filenames and file-like objects as input. `partition` also has some includes some optional kwargs. For example, if you set `include_page_breaks=True`, the output will include `PageBreak` elements if the filetype supports it. See the\n",

    "The `unstructured` library also includes partitioning bricks targeted at specific document types. The `partition` brick uses these document-specific partitioning bricks under the hood. There are a few reasons you may want to use a document-specific partitioning brick instead of `partition`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you already know the document type, filetype detection is unnecessary. Using the document-specific brick directly will make your program run faster.\n",
    "2. Fewer dependencies. You don't need to install `libmagic` for filetype detection if you're only using document-specific bricks.\n",
    "3. Additional features. The API for `partition` is the least common denominator for all document types. Certain document-specific brick include extra features that you may want to take advantage of. For example, `partition_html` allows you to pass in a URL so you don't have to store the `.html` file locally.\n",

    "Currently, the partitioning bricks we support in `unstructured` are:\n",

    "    - Can pass in the HTML document as a string using the `text` kwarg.\n",
    "    - Can pass in the URL for an HTML document using the `url` kwarg.\n",
    "- `partition_pdf`\n",
    "    - Works on `.pdf` files. Partitions the document using a document image analysis model.\n",
    "    - If `url=None`, the model will run locally. If you pass in a URL, the brick will make a network call\n",
    "      to a hosted model inference API. There is also an optional `token` kwarg for passing in an authentication token.\n",
    "- `partition_image`\n",
    "    - Has the same API as `partition_pdf`. Works on `.jpg` and `.png` files.\n",
    "- `partition_email`\n",
    "    - Works on `.eml` files. Most common email clients (i.e. Gmail, Microsoft Outlook) allow users to export emails in\n",
    "      `.eml` format.\n",
    "    - Parses the `text/html` content from the email by default. If you set `content_source=\"text/plain\"`, the brick will parse the plain text instead.\n",
    "    - If you set `include_headers=True`, the output will include information from the email header.\n",
