    "The goal of this notebook is to introduce you to the concept of bricks. Bricks are functions that live in `unstructured` and are the primary public API for the library. There are three types of bricks in `unstructured`, corresponding to the different stages of document pre-processing: partitioning, cleaning, and staging. At the conclusion of this notebook, you should be able to do the following:\n",

    "Partitioning bricks in `unstructured` allow users to extract structured content from a raw unstructured document. As we covered in the [core concepts notebook](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/blob/main/examples/training/0-Core%20Concepts.ipynb), partitioning bricks break a document down into elements such as `Title`, `NarrativeText`, and `ListItem`, enabling users to decide what content they'd like to keep for their particular application. If you're training a summarization model, for example, you may only be interested in `NarrativeText`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to partition documents in `unstructured` is to use the `partition` brick. If you call the `partition` brick, `unstructured` will use `libmagic` to automatically determine the file type and invoke the appropriate `partition` function. As shown in the examples below, the `partition` function accepts both filenames and file-like objects as input. `partition` also has some includes some optional kwargs. For example, if you set `include_page_breaks=True`, the output will include `PageBreak` elements if the filetype supports it. See the\n",

      "\n",
      "Deep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of document image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classiﬁcation [11,\n",
      "\n",
      "<PAGE BREAK>\n",
      "\n",
      "37], layout detection [38, 22], table detection [26], and scene text detection [4]. A generalized learning-based framework dramatically reduces the need for the manual speciﬁcation of complicated rules, which is the status quo with traditional methods. DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and beneﬁt a broad spectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are several practical diﬃculties for taking advantages of re- cent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted for reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame- works like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can be obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and frustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA, and many researchers who would beneﬁt the most from using these methods lack the technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images contain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training is often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no full-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets and ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of models and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams use DL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes, and these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not documented at all). This makes it diﬃcult for research teams to learn about how full pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources in reinventing the DIA wheel .\n"

    "The `unstructured` library also includes partitioning bricks targeted at specific document types. The `partition` brick uses these document-specific partitioning bricks under the hood. There are a few reasons you may want to use a document-specific partitioning brick instead of `partition`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you already know the document type, filetype detection is unnecessary. Using the document-specific brick directly will make your program run faster.\n",
    "2. Fewer dependencies. You don't need to install `libmagic` for filetype detection if you're only using document-specific bricks.\n",
    "3. Additional features. The API for `partition` is the least common denominator for all document types. Certain document-specific brick include extra features that you may want to take advantage of. For example, `partition_html` allows you to pass in a URL so you don't have to store the `.html` file locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the partitioning bricks we support in `unstructured` are:\n",

    "- `partition_pptx`\n",
    "    - Works on `.pptx` files. Does not yet work on older `.ppt` files.\n",
    "- `partition_html`\n",
    "    - Works on `.html` files.\n",
    "    - Can pass in the HTML document as a string using the `text` kwarg.\n",
    "    - Can pass in the URL for an HTML document using the `url` kwarg.\n",
    "- `partition_pdf`\n",
    "    - Works on `.pdf` files. Partitions the document using a document image analysis model.\n",
    "    - If `url=None`, the model will run locally. If you pass in a URL, the brick will make a network call\n",
    "      to a hosted model inference API. There is also an optional `token` kwarg for passing in an authentication token.\n",
    "- `partition_image`\n",
    "    - Has the same API as `partition_pdf`. Works on `.jpg` and `.png` files.\n",
    "- `partition_email`\n",
    "    - Works on `.eml` files. Most common email clients (i.e. Gmail, Microsoft Outlook) allow users to export emails in\n",
    "      `.eml` format.\n",
    "    - Parses the `text/html` content from the email by default. If you set `content_source=\"text/plain\"`, the brick will parse the plain text instead.\n",
    "    - If you set `include_headers=True`, the output will include information from the email header.\n",
    "    - You can pass in the email as a string using the `text` kwarg.\n",

Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin stated on February 8 that the Russian government will subsidize investment projects for the modernization of enterprises operating in the interests of the Russian military and will allocate significant funds for manufacturing new military equipment. Mishustin also stated that the Russian government would extend benefits to Russian entrepreneurs who support the Russian military, including extended payment periods on rented federal property. The Kremlin likely intends these measures to augment its overarching effort to gradually prepare Russia’s military industry for a protracted war in Ukraine while avoiding a wider economic mobilization that would create further domestic economic disruptions and corresponding discontent.'"
