# Biomedical documents can be extracted in one of two ways, in this script is the FTP directory approach.

# The supported ftp directories is:

# By providing the path, the documents existing therein are downloaded.
# For example, to download the documents in the path: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/07/
# The path needed is oa_pdf/07/

# The example below will ingest the PDF from the "oa_pdf/07/07/sbaa031.073.PMC7234218.pdf" path.

# You can ingest all the documents in the "oa_pdf/07/07" path by passing "oa_pdf/07/07" instead.
# WARNING: There are many documents in that path.
