# Processes the Unstructured-IO/unstructured repository

# Structured outputs are stored in google-drive-ingest-output/

# NOTE, this script is not ready-to-run!
# You must enter a Drive ID and a Drive Service Account Key before running.

# You can find out how to the Service account Key:
# https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#service-account

# The File or Folder ID can be gotten from the url of the file, such as:
# https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/{folder-id}
# https://drive.google.com/file/d/{file-id}

# NOTE: Using the Service Account key only works when the file or folder
# is shared atleast with permission for "Anyone with the link" to view
# OR the email address for the service account is given access to the file
# or folder.
