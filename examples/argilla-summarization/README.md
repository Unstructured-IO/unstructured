## ISW Summarization Example

This directory shows and example of how to use `unstructured`, `argilla`, and `transformers`
to train a custom summarization model on Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reports
about the was in Ukraine. This example shows how, by combining these three libraries, you can
complete a data science project in hours that previously would have taken weeks.

To get started, use the following steps:

- Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed on your system
- Create a new Python virtual environment
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies
- Run `PYTHONPATH=. jupyter notebook` from this directory to launch the notebook

At this point, you'll be able to run the model training notebook.
