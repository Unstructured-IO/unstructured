## SEC Sentiment Analysis Model

This directory contains an example of how to use the SEC API, the Unstructured SEC pipeline API,
and several bricks from the `unstructured` library to train a sentiment analysis model for the
risk factors section of S-1 filings. To get started, use the following steps:

- Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system
- Create a new Python virtual environment
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies
- Run `PYTHONPATH=. jupyter notebook` from this directory to launch the notebook

At this point, you'll be able to run the sentiment analysis example notebook.
