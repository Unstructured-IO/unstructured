Without tooling from the modern LLM stack, this would have been a time-consuming project. With Unstructured, Chroma, and LangChain, the entire workflow is less than two dozen lines of code."

Kennedy Jr. has confirmed that among his potential vice-presidential prospects is New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers,\\xa0who\\xa0in private conversations shared deranged conspiracy theories\\xa0about the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting not being real.\\n\\nCNN knows of two people with whom Rodgers has enthusiastically shared these stories,\\xa0including with Pamela Brown, one of the journalists writing this piece.\\n\\nBrown was covering the Kentucky Derby for CNN in\\xa02013\\xa0when she was introduced to Rodgers, then with the Green Bay Packers, at a post-Derby party. Hearing that she was a journalist with CNN, Rodgers immediately began attacking the news media for covering up important stories. Rodgers brought up the tragic killing\\xa0of 20 children and 6 adults by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School,\\xa0claiming\\xa0it was actually a government inside job and the media was intentionally ignoring it.\\n\\nWhen Brown questioned him on the evidence to show this very real shooting was staged, Rodgers began sharing various theories that have been disproven numerous times. Such conspiracy theories were also later at the center of lawsuits brought by victims’ families when they sued conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on the matter.\\n\\nJones baselessly repeating lies that the 2012 mass shooting was staged, and that the families and first responders were “crisis actors,” spawned multiple lawsuits and a trial was held in 2022 over lawsuits that were filed in Connecticut.\\n\\nFamily members throughout that trial described in poignant terms how the lies had prompted unrelenting harassment against them and compounded the emotional agony of losing their loved ones.\\n\\nBrown recalls Rodgers asking her if she thought it was off that there were men in black in the woods by the school,\\xa0falsely\\xa0claiming those men were actually government operatives. Brown found the encounter disturbing.\\n\\nRodgers, through one of his agents, declined to comment to CNN.\\n\\nCNN has spoken to another person with a similar story. This person, to whom CNN has granted anonymity so as to avoid harassment, recalled that several years ago, Rodgers claimed, “Sandy Hook never happened…All those children never existed. They were all actors.”\\n\\nWhen asked about the grieving parents, the source recalled Rodgers saying, “They’re all making it up. They’re all actors.”\\n\\nRodgers went on to delve into some of the darker caverns of the false conspiracy theory. This person found the encounter disturbing.\\n\\nKennedy’s campaign\\xa0announced Wednesday that the candidate will name his running mate on March 26 in Oakland, California. Kennedy told CNN in an interview on Tuesday that he had recently met with Rodgers, as well as former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, about the possibility of joining his campaign.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.
