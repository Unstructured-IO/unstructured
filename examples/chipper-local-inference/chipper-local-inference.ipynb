    "This notebook demonstrates and explains how to parse a PDF file using `chipper` model locally through our main libraries. If you want to run this notebook in Google Colab taking into account that making an inference using `chipper` in CPU can take while; switching the runtime from \"CPU\" to GPU `T4` (or any other available) will reduce the runtime and is strongly recommended. You can use the following commands to install the required libraries:\n",
