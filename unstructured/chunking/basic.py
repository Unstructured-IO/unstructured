"""Implementation of baseline chunking.

This is the "plain-vanilla" chunking strategy. All the fundamental chunking behaviors are present in
this strategy and also in all other strategies. Those are:

- Maximally fill each chunk with sequential elements.
- Isolate oversized elements and divide (only) those chunks by text-splitting.
- Overlap when requested.

"Fancier" strategies add higher-level semantic-unit boundaries to be respected. For example, in the
by-title strategy, section boundaries are respected, meaning a chunk never contains text from two
different sections. When a new section is detected the current chunk is closed and a new one
started.

    Produces a sequence of `CompositeElement`, `Table`, and `TableChunk` elements (chunks).

    Parameters
    ----------
    elements
        A list of unstructured elements. Usually the output of a partition function.
    max_characters
        Hard maximum chunk length. No chunk will exceed this length. A single element that exceeds
        this length will be divided into two or more chunks using text-splitting.
    new_after_n_chars
        A chunk that of this length or greater is not extended to include the next element, even if
        that element would fit without exceeding `max_characters`. A "soft max" length that can be
        used in conjunction with `max_characters` to limit most chunks to a preferred length while
        still allowing larger elements to be included in a single chunk without resorting to
        text-splitting. Defaults to `max_characters` when not specified, which effectively disables
        any soft window. Specifying 0 for this argument causes each element to appear in a chunk by
        itself (although an element with text longer than `max_characters` will be still be split
        into two or more chunks).
    overlap
        Specifies the length of a string ("tail") to be drawn from each chunk and prefixed to the
        next chunk as a context-preserving mechanism. By default, this only applies to split-chunks
        where an oversized element is divided into multiple chunks by text-splitting.
    overlap_all
        Default: `False`. When `True`, apply overlap between "normal" chunks formed from whole
        elements and not subject to text-splitting. Use this with caution as it produces a certain
        level of "pollution" of otherwise clean semantic chunk boundaries.
