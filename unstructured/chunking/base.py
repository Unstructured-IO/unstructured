# CHUNKING OPTIONS
# ================================================================================================


class ChunkingOptions:
    """Specifies parameters of optional chunking behaviors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_characters
        Hard-maximum text-length of chunk. A chunk longer than this will be split mid-text and be
        emitted as two or more chunks.
    new_after_n_chars
        Preferred approximate chunk size. A chunk composed of elements totalling this size or
        greater is considered "full" and will not be enlarged by adding another element, even if it
        will fit within the remaining `max_characters` for that chunk. Defaults to `max_characters`
        when not specified, which effectively disables this behavior. Specifying 0 for this
        argument causes each element to appear in a chunk by itself (although an element with text
        longer than `max_characters` will be still be split into two or more chunks).
    combine_text_under_n_chars
        Provides a way to "recombine" small chunks formed by breaking on a semantic boundary. Only
        relevant for a chunking strategy that specifies higher-level semantic boundaries to be
        respected, like "section" or "page". Recursively combines two adjacent pre-chunks when the
        first pre-chunk is smaller than this threshold. "Recursively" here means the resulting
        pre-chunk can be combined with the next pre-chunk if it is still under the length threshold.
        Defaults to `max_characters` which combines chunks whenever space allows. Specifying 0 for
        this argument suppresses combining of small chunks. Note this value is "capped" at the
        `new_after_n_chars` value since a value higher than that would not change this parameter's
        effect.
    overlap
        Specifies the length of a string ("tail") to be drawn from each chunk and prefixed to the
        next chunk as a context-preserving mechanism. By default, this only applies to split-chunks
        where an oversized element is divided into multiple chunks by text-splitting.
    overlap_all
        Default: `False`. When `True`, apply overlap between "normal" chunks formed from whole
        elements and not subject to text-splitting. Use this with caution as it entails a certain
        level of "pollution" of otherwise clean semantic chunk boundaries.
    text_splitting_separators
        A sequence of strings like `("\n", " ")` to be used as target separators during
        text-splitting. Text-splitting only applies to splitting an oversized element into two or
        more chunks. These separators are tried in the specified order until one is found in the
        string to be split. The default separator is `""` which matches between any two characters.
        This separator should not be specified in this sequence because it is always the separator
        of last-resort. Note that because the separator is removed during text-splitting, only
        whitespace character sequences are suitable.
