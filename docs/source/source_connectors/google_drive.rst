Google Drive
=============
Connect Google Drive to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents using ``unstructured-ingest`` to store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

First you'll need to install the Google Drive dependencies as shown here.

.. code:: shell

  pip install "unstructured[gdrive]"

Run Locally

   .. tab:: Shell

      .. code:: shell

        unstructured-ingest \
          google-drive \
          --drive-id "<file or folder id>" \
          --service-account-key "<path to drive service account key>" \
          --output-dir google-drive-ingest-output \
          --num-processes 2 \
          --recursive \
          --verbose \

   .. tab:: Python

      .. code:: python

        from unstructured.ingest.interfaces import PartitionConfig, ReadConfig
        from unstructured.ingest.runner.google_drive import gdrive

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            gdrive(
                verbose=True,
                read_config=ReadConfig(),
                partition_config=PartitionConfig(
                    output_dir="google-drive-ingest-output",
                    num_processes=2,
                ),
                drive_id="POPULATE WITH FILE OR FOLDER ID",
                service_account_key="POPULATE WITH DRIVE SERVICE ACCOUNT KEY",
                recursive=True,
            )

Run via the API
---------------

You can also use upstream connectors with the ``unstructured`` API. For this you'll need to use the ``--partition-by-api`` flag and pass in your API key with ``--api-key``.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Shell

      .. code:: shell

        unstructured-ingest \
          google-drive \
          --drive-id "<file or folder id>" \
          --service-account-key "<path to drive service account key>" \
          --output-dir google-drive-ingest-output \
          --num-processes 2 \
          --recursive \
          --verbose \
          --partition-by-api \
          --api-key "<UNSTRUCTURED-API-KEY>"

   .. tab:: Python

      .. code:: python

        import os

        from unstructured.ingest.interfaces import PartitionConfig, ReadConfig
        from unstructured.ingest.runner.google_drive import gdrive

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            gdrive(
                verbose=True,
                read_config=ReadConfig(),
                partition_config=PartitionConfig(
                    output_dir="google-drive-ingest-output",
                    num_processes=2,
                    partition_by_api=True,
                    api_key=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
                ),
                drive_id="POPULATE WITH FILE OR FOLDER ID",
                service_account_key="POPULATE WITH DRIVE SERVICE ACCOUNT KEY",
                recursive=True,
            )

Additionally, you will need to pass the ``--partition-endpoint`` if you're running the API locally. You can find more information about the ``unstructured`` API `here <https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-api>`_.

For a full list of the options the CLI accepts check ``unstructured-ingest gdrive --help``.

NOTE: Keep in mind that you will need to have all the appropriate extras and dependencies for the file types of the documents contained in your data storage platform if you're running this locally. You can find more information about this in the `installation guide <https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/installing.html>`_.
