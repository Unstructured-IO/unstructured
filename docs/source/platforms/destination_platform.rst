Platform Destination Connectors
===============================

Destination Connectors in the ``Unstructured Platform`` are designed to specify the endpoint for data processed within the platform. These connectors ensure that the transformed and analyzed data is securely and efficiently transferred to a storage system for future use, often to a vector database for tasks that involve high-speed retrieval and advanced data analytics operations.
