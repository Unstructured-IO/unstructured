Jobs Scheduling
===============

Job Dashboard
--------------

The job dashboard provides a centralized view for managing and monitoring the execution of data processing tasks within your workflows.

**Here is how to navigate and view job status:**

- The central panel lists all jobs with their associated workflow’s **Name**, **ID**, **Status**, and **Execution Start Time**.

- The **Status** column provides at-a-glance information:

  - A ``New`` status indicates a job has been created but has yet to run.

  - A ``Scheduled`` status shows that a job is set to run at a future date and time, as indicated in the 'Execution Start Time' column.

  - A ``Partitioning`` status means that documents are currently being processed.

  - A ``Finished`` status indicates the job has been completed.

  - A ``Failed`` status indicates the job has encountered some errors.

The Job Details page is a comprehensive section for monitoring the specific details of jobs executed within a particular workflow. To access this page, click the specific *Workflow* or *ID* on the Job Dashboard.

Here is the information provided by the Job Details page:

- **Job Summary**: At the top of the dashboard, you will see the following document status:

  - ``Documents``: Total number of documents included in the workflow.
  - ``New``: number of new documents to be processed.
  - ``Partitioning``: number of documents being processed.
  - ``Finished``: number of documents that have been completed.
  - ``Failed``: number of documents that failed to be processed.

- **Job Status and Execution Information**: The page provides a detailed log of the job's execution, including ``status``, ``expected execution time``, and ``Job ID`` for reference.

- **Activity Logs**: The activity logs display a timestamped sequence of events during the job's execution. This can include when new documents are found, when documents are processed, and any errors or messages related to the job.
