Example: Parsing a Document via SaaS API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please refer to the sample code and output provided below to begin processing documents with your SaaS API.

.. warning::
    When using the Command Line Interface (CLI), ensure that you copy the complete SaaS API URL provided in your email. This URL should include the specific path ``/general/v0/general``.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Make sure to replace the placeholders with the actual URL and API key from your email
    # Include the path `/general/v0/general` in the URL.

    curl -X 'POST' 'https://<REPLACE WITH THE URL IN THE EMAIL>'
         -H 'accept: application/json'
         -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data'
         -H 'unstructured-api-key: <REPLACE WITH API KEY IN THE EMAIL>'
         -F 'files=@sample-docs/family-day.eml'

Or, you can use `partition_via_api <https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/core/partition.html#partition-via-api>`__ to access the SaaS API URL.

.. code:: python

  from unstructured.partition.api import partition_via_api

  filename = "example-docs/eml/fake-email.eml"

  elements = partition_via_api(
    filename=filename,
    api_key=<<REPLACE WITH YOUR API KEY>>,
    api_url="https://<<REPLACE WITH YOUR SERVER URL>>/general/v0/general"
  )

.. warning::
    When using the Unstructured `Python SDK <https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client>`__ or `JavaScript SDK <https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client>`__, it is important to **omit** the path ``/general/v0/general`` from the ``server_url`` parameter. Additionally, ensure you use ``https`` in the URL to prevent potential errors.

.. code-block:: python

    from unstructured_client import UnstructuredClient

    # Remember NOT to include `/general/v0/general` in the `server_url`
    s = UnstructuredClient(api_key_auth="<YOUR_API_KEY>",  # Replace <YOUR_API_KEY> with the API key provided in the email
                           server_url="<YOUR_SERVER_URL>") # Replace <YOUR_SERVER_URL> with the server URL provided in the email
