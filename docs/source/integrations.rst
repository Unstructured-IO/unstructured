Integrations
======
Integrate your model development pipeline with your favorite machine learning frameworks and libraries, and prepare your data for ingestion into downstream systems. For instance, you can check our example notebook to format and upload the risk section from an SEC filing to LabelStudio for a sentiment analysis labeling task `here <https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/examples.html#sentiment-analysis-labeling-in-labelstudio>`_ . Integrations are result of our `staging bricks <https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/bricks.html#staging>`_, design to get a list of document elements as input and return an appropriately formatted dictionary as output.
