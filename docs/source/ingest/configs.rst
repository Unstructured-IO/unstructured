Ingest Configuration
======================

A comprehensive list of common configurations plays a pivotal role in structuring the data required to execute an
ingest process effectively. These configurations encompass a range of parameters and settings that guide how data
is collected, transformed, and stored. Common configurations may include data format
specifications, destination targets, data partitioning strategies, error handling rules, and transformation
routines. By defining and organizing these configurations, users can establish a clear and consistent
framework for data ingestion processes, ensuring that data is ingested, processed, and delivered accurately,
securely, and efficiently. Such a structured approach to data configuration forms the foundation for robust
and reliable data ingestion systems across various domains and applications.
