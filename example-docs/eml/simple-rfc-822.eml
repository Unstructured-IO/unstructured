Subject: Example RFC 822 Email

This is an RFC 822 email message.

An RFC 822 message is characterized by its simple, text-based format, which includes a header and a body. The header contains structured fields such as "From", "To", "Date", and "Subject", each followed by a colon and the corresponding information. The body follows the header, separated by a blank line, and contains the main content of the email.

The structure ensures compatibility and readability across different email systems and clients, adhering to the standards set by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
