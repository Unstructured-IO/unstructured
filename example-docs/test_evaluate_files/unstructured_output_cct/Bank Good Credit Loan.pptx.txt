Design
Data to be downloaded using SQL queries.
Required information to be extracted from Account and Enquiry files and converted to one-to-one files.
The columns from the two files should be merged with Demographic file using Left Join with “customer no” as key column, to create a final file. The final file should contain all the records in demographic and additional columns/features from Account and Enquiry files will get added to Demographic file.
There will be many customers in account and enquiry file who will get left out. This is fine as we anyway don’t know their good/bad label for training purpose.
