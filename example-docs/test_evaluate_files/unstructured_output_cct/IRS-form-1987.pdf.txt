In addition, gross receipts include any income from investments and from incidental or outside sources (e.g., interest, dividends, rents, royalties, and annuities). However, if you are a resaler of personal property, exclude from gross receipts any amounts not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Gross receipts do not include amounts received for sales taxes if, under the applicable state or local law, the tax is legally imposed on the purchaser of the good or service, and the taxpayer merely collects and remits the tax to the taxing authority.

(manufacturing, retailer, wholesaler, etc.), employer identification number, overall method of accounting, and whether, in the last 6 years, that business has changed its accounting method, or is also changing its accounting method as part of this request or as a separate request.

(1) Gives your best estimate of the percentage of the section 481(a) adjustment that would have been required if the requested change had been made for each of the 3 preceding years; and
(2) Explains in detail why you cannot provide the requested information.

(1) Farming businesses.—F or this purpose, the term “farming business” 1s defined in section 263A(e)(4), but it also includes the raising, harvesting, or growing of trees to which section 263A(c)(5) applies.

If the corporation or partnership was not in existence for the entire 3-year period, the period of existence is used to determine whether the corporation or partnership qualifies. If any tax year in the 3-year period is a short tax year, the corporation or partnership must annualize the gross receipts by multiplying the gross receipts by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months in the short period.
